Download the repository as a zip by clicking the green button up and to the right.

Then open a terminal and go into this folder (`cd LogisticMetrics` from the folder above).

At the terminal type 

`pixi install`

That should install the prerequisites.

To work in jupyterlab type 

`pixi run jupyter lab .`

This will bring up the jupyterlab interface in your browser. You can click on the notebook file to run it.

You can also work in Colab.

There are 4 simple questions(only about 4-5 lines of code for you to type), but a decent bit of reading for you to do. Assume 1-3 hours max.

Make sure you save the notebook from time to time.

Upload (1) the notebook with questions answered (.ipynb file) and (2) a html file produced using the save-and-export submenu in the file menu.
